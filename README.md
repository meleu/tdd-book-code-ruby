This is a repository containing my (@meleu) Ruby code version for the ["Learning Test-Driven Development"](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-test-driven-development/9781098106461/) book, published by O'Reilly (the book uses Go, JavaScript and Python).

# Prerequisites

You need to install the runtime environments for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) to run the code in this repo.

This repo comes with a `.tool-versions` file, which makes it easier to install Ruby if you use [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev).

Beyond Ruby, you may need other tools -- e.g. ["act"](https://github.com/nektos/act) to run the GitHub actions locally, and [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/) for static analysis of Ruby code.

To understand the evolution and purpose of the code, you need the accompanying book.

# How to run tests

In brief, use the following commands to run the tests:

```bash
ruby rb/money_test.rb
```

# How to get the book

The book is available at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Test-Driven-Development-Polyglot-Uncluttered/dp/1098106474/ref=sr_1_3?) and [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-test-driven-development/9781098106461/).
